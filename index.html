            <h3> DUBAI</h3>
            <p>
            Located in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula on the coast of the Persian Gulf, 
            Dubai aims to be the business hub of Western Asia. It is also a major global transport
            hub for passengers and cargo. Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of the city, 
            which was already a major mercantile hub. Dubai's oil output made up 2.1 percent of the 
            Persian Gulf emirate's economy in 2008. A centre for regional and international trade 
            since the early 20th century, Dubai's economy relies on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation,
            real estate, and financial services. According 
            to government data, the population of Dubai is estimated at around 3,400,800 as of 8 September 2020.

            <h3>Geography</h3>
            <p>
            Dubai is situated on the Persian Gulf coast of the United Arab Emirates and is roughly at sea level
            (16 m or 52 ft above). The emirate of Dubai shares borders with Abu Dhabi in the south, Sharjah in the
            northeast, and the Sultanate of Oman in the southeast. Hatta, a minor exclave of the emirate, is surrounded
            on three sides by Oman and by the emirates of Ajman (in the west) and Ras Al Khaimah (in the north). 
            The Persian Gulf borders the western coast of the emirate. Dubai is positioned at 25.2697°N 55.3095°E and
            covers an area of 1,588 sq mi (4,110 km2), which represents a significant expansion beyond its initial
             1,500 sq mi (3,900 km2) designation due to land reclamation from the sea.

            <h3>Government</h3>
            <p>
            Dubai has been ruled by the Al Maktoum family since 1833; the emirate is a constitutional monarchy.
            Dubai citizens participate in the electoral college to vote representatives to the Federal National
            Council of the UAE. The ruler, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is also the 
            Vice-President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates and member of the Supreme Council of 
            the Union (SCU). Dubai appoints 8 members in two-term periods to the Federal National Council (FNC)
            of the UAE, the supreme federal legislative body.
